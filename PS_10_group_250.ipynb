    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements the A* pathfinding algorithm to solve a maze navigation problem. The algorithm finds the optimal path from a start position to a goal position while considering movement costs and heuristic estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setup\n",
    "- **Grid Size**: 6 rows × 7 columns\n",
    "- **Start Position**: (3, 0) - Row 3, Column 0\n",
    "- **Goal Position**: (3, 6) - Row 3, Column 6\n",
    "- **Movement Cost**: Base cost of 3 units per move\n",
    "- **East Penalty**: Additional cost of 5 units when moving east (right)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Maze Representation\n",
    "The maze is represented using two separate 2D arrays:\n",
    "- `horizontal_walls`: Tracks walls between vertically adjacent cells\n",
    "- `vertical_walls`: Tracks walls between horizontally adjacent cells\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cost Function\n",
    "- **Base Movement Cost**: 3 units for any valid move\n",
    "- **Eastward Movement Penalty**: Additional 5 units (total 8 units when moving east)\n",
    "- This creates a preference for paths that minimize eastward movement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Heuristic Function\n",
    "- Uses **Manhattan Distance**: |x₁ - x₂| + |y₁ - y₂|\n",
    "- Weighted by parameter `w` to control algorithm behavior:\n",
    "  - `w = 1.0`: Optimal A* (guaranteed shortest path)\n",
    "  - `w > 1.0`: Weighted A* (faster but potentially suboptimal)\n",
